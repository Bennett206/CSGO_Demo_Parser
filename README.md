# CSGO_Demo_Parser

## This is a simple demo parser script using [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy).
- Currently the only changes that the user needs to make is the path to your file containing CSGO demos within the config.ini file.
- Demo parsing takes a few seconds per demo, so be patient!
- The result will be a .json file, and from there you will be able to use that data in whatever way you choose
