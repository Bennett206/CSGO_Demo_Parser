# CSGO_Demo_Parser

## This is a simple demo parser script using [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy).
- User needs to change the file path in the `config.ini` file to your own file containing CSGO demos.
- Demo parsing takes a few seconds per demo, so be patient!
- The result will be a directory `ParsedReplays` that houses the .json file(s).
- From there you will be able to use that data in whatever way you choose.
